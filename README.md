## I am currently working on [Zorro](https://crllect.github.io/zorro). A front-end-only unblocked game site. I know, very original. If anybody wants to help add games or improve upon it, add me on discord [@crllect](https://discord.com/users/713488984596021291).
## I am also working on [Xorro](https://github.com/crllect/xorro), which if you couldn't tell, is a placeholder name cus I couldn't think of anything.
